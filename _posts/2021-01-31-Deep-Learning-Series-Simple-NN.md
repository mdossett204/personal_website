This is the first post of the deep learning series where we will go over the basic concepts of deep learning including but not limited to basic shallow network, deep neural network, convolutional neural network(CNN), and recurent neural network(rnn). 


In this post, we will go over the basic structure of a simple one layer neural network and compare that to a logistic regression model.

## Summary



## Next Blog 
In the next blog, we will go over cost functions in a simple Neuarl Network and Gradient descent for optimization.
