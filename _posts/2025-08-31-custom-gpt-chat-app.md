## The Problem

With GPT-5's recent launch, OpenAI's web interface has become more restrictive. Users are locked into whatever model OpenAI chooses as the default, losing the flexibility to select models based on their specific needs, budget, or use case.

## The Solution

I built a custom Gradio interface that gives you complete control over OpenAI's model ecosystem. This tool lets you:

**Choose your model**: o3, o3-mini, o4-mini, GPT-4 family, and GPT-5 family

**Control parameters**: Temperature and max output tokens for GPT-4 family

**Save conversations**: Organized in folders of your choice

**Costs awareness**: Model pricing information for informed decisions

## Gradio App Demo

## Technical Implementation

This gradio app uses OpenAI's API directly, bypassing the web interface limitations. For detailed code implemenation, see [here](https://github.com/mdossett204/random-ai-projects/blob/main/custom_gpt_app/gradio_chat_app.py).

## Cost Analysis

**API vs Subscription**:

ChatGPT Plus: $20/month (locked to limited model choices)
API Usage: Pay per token (choose optimal model for each task)

- Example: GPT-4.1-nano at $0.10/$0.40 per 1M tokens (input/output) vs GPT-5 at $1.25/$10.00 per 1M tokens (input/output)

## Why This Matters for You

This approach demonstrates key principles:

- **flexibilility over convenience**

- **cost optimization through model selection and max output token**

- **direct API integration with temperature control**

- **Security-first design**
  - no cross chat history reference
  - you get to choose where and when your conversations will be saved.

**The future of AI tooling is about building custom solutions that fit your exact needs, not being constrained by vendor UIs.**
