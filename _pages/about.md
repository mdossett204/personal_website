Hi everyone! Welcome to my personal website.  My name is Mindy, a data enthusiast. 

Machine learning, deep learning, data engineering, and feature engineering absolutely excite me. I am a firm believer that business solutions and market insights can be uncovered by delving into the data:

In my previous job, I was fortunate to be able to experiment and build deep learning/machine learning models in Hadoop/Spark environment to catch identity thieves and protect innocent victims. Additionally, I got the opportunity to build end to end machine learning pipelines for production. This allowed me to see the real world impact of AI.

Currently, I am working as a geospatial data scientist and data engineer for Bloomberg. I love making big visible impact using data and programming. 

Outside my work, I love learning new programming languages to keep reinforcing computational thinking and algorithmic problem solving. Although I use Python, Scala, and SQL everyday for my job, my current obsession is Java. I am also hoping to learn Rust and become a software engineer in 2021. 

Another hobby of mine is to experiment with various machine learning/deep learning models using kaggle datasets with the goal of deploying some of the working models on AWS using a serverless architecture. 

The purpose of this personal website is to share some of my data science projects and code snippets. 

If you would like to collaborate on a data science project or if you have any questions about any of the posts, please feel free to contact me.
