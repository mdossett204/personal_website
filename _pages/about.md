Hi there! I’m a materials scientist who took a curious detour and ended up knee-deep in data pipelines, machine learning models, and cloud-native architectures—and I couldn’t be happier about it.

These days, I spend my time wrangling high-quality data to extract meaningful product and market insights using a mix of analytics, ML, and AI. I’m especially enthusiastic about cloud technologies (because who doesn’t love near-infinite compute power at their fingertips?) and currently obsessed with agentic workflow frameworks for enterprise solutions—yes, it’s as cool as it sounds.

Beyond work, I’m a lifelong learner with a healthy addiction to anything that piques my curiosity. When I’m not exploring tech frontiers, I’m geeking out over longevity science, outdoor adventures, wellness, and occasionally trying to convince others that hiking counts as meditation.

Always learning, always building—ideally with a good cup of coffee in hand.
