Hi everyone! Welcome to my personal website.  My name is Mindy, a data enthusiast. 

Machine learning, deep learning, data engineering, and feature engineering absolutely excite me. I am a firm believer that business solutions and market insights can be uncovered by delving into the data:

> Strong knowledge in computational thinking, statistical insights, and big data management with a cloud based serverless platform can be a powerful combination for finding the right path in any business application.

In my previous job, I was fortunate to be able to experiment and build deep learning/machine learning models in Hadoop/Spark environment to catch identity thieves and protect innocent victims. Additionally, I got the opportunity to build end to end machine learning pipelines for production. This allowed me to see the real world impact of AI.

Currently, I am working as a data engineer for data insights technology team where we use data to drive investment research insights. 

Outside my work, I love learning new programming languages to keep reinforcing computational thinking and algorithmic problem solving. Although I use Python and SQL everyday for my job, I am also hoping to get more hands on experience with Java and go. 

Another hobby of mine is to experiment with various machine learning/deep learning models using kaggle datasets with the goal of deploying some of the working models on AWS using a serverless architecture. 

The purpose of this personal website is to share some of my personal interests in technology. 

If you would like to collaborate on a project or if you have any questions about any of the posts, please feel free to contact me.
